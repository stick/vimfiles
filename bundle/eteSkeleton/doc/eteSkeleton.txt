                                                    *eteSkeleton-introduction*

This is the first plugin I've developed; I hope you will find it useful. 
|eteSkeleton| is a simple plugin that helps you to manage your skeleton files and
handle tags. When you create a new file, |eteSkeleton| scans your skeleton 
folder for any files that are of the same filetype as the new file. 
When |eteSkeleton| finds several files that matches the filetype of the new 
file, it will compare the files and locate the one which bears a similar 
filename as the new file. As |eteSkeleton| locates such a file, it will copy 
the runtime path / skeleton of the file to the new file.

example >
        ~/.vim/skeleton/python
        ~/.vim/skeleton/test_python 

        :e test_script.py

        In this case, |eteSkeleton| will load the "test_python" skeleton file.

Once the skeleton is loaded, the tags in the "test_script.py" file will be 
replaced by the tags in eteSskeleton.tags (which are located in the plugin 
directory).

USAGE                                                   *eteSkeleton-usage*

Once you've created your skeleton and placed it into the skeleton folder, just
start a new buffer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS                                                *eteSkeleton-commands*

                                                        *:EteSkeleton*
:EteSkeleton 
        This command calls to load the skeleton for the current buffer.
        |eteSkeleton| compares the filenames of the files in the skeleton 
        folder and retrieve the suitable skeleton to place in the buffer. 

                                                        *:EteSkelList*
:EteSkelList
        This command calls to show the tag list in the "eteSkeleton.tags" file.
        It allows you to check the tags. 

                                                        *:EteSkelAdd*
:EteSkelAdd {tagname[=tagvlue]}
        This is to add or replace a tag {tagname} in the tag list. If you 
        don't specify the value {=tagvalue}, |eteSkeleton| will ask you to give 
        a value.

                                                        *:EteSkelAddTag*
:EteSkelAddTag
        This command is useful when you are writing templates. Place the cursor 
        above a word, and then add or replace the word with a tag.
        It is mapped as <Leader>st.

                                                        *:EteSkelDel*
:EteSkelDel {tagname}
        This command helps you to remove {tagname} from the "eteSkeleton.tags" 
        file.

                                                        *:EteSkelMake*
:EteSkelMake [{skeletonname}]
        Save the current buffer as a skeleton (in the skeleton path) using
        {skeletonname} and reload it. If no skeleton name is provided
        eteSkeleton will use the current buffer name trying to replace the word
        'type' with the current filetype. So for the buffer 'test-type.py' it 
        will create the skeleton 'skeleton/test-python'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TAGS                                                    *eteSkeleton-tags*

Tags are a simple list of tagname=tagvalue stored in the "eteSkeleton.tags" 
file (which is located in the plugin folder). It can be manually edited or 
modified by the eteSkeleton commands. Please note that the {tagname} must be 
written without the <> symbols in the tag list; however, as the {tagvalue} will 
be evaluated, you must use quotes (i.e. " ") when you write Strings.

BUGS                                                    *eteSkeleton-bugs*

I haven't yet tested the software thoroughly :p
